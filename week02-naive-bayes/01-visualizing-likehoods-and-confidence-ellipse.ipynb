    "# Visualizing Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will cover an essential part of data analysis that has not been included in the lecture videos. As we stated in the previous module, data visualization gives insight into the expected performance of any model. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercise, you are going to make a visual inspection of the tweets dataset using the Naïve Bayes features. We will see how we can understand the log-likelihood ratio explained in the videos as a pair of numerical features that can be fed in a machine learning algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this lab, we will introduce the concept of __confidence ellipse__ as a tool for representing the Naïve Bayes model visually."
